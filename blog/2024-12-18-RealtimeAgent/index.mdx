### **Tutorial: Integrating RealtimeAgent with Swarm Teams**

In this tutorial, we’ll demonstrate how to implement OpenAI's [Airline Customer Service Example](https://github.com/openai/swarm/tree/main/examples/airline) using AG2's new **RealtimeAgent**. By leveraging real-time capabilities, you can create a seamless voice-driven experience for customer service tasks, enhanced with Swarm's task orchestration for efficient problem-solving.

This guide will walk you through the setup, implementation, and connection process, ensuring you’re ready to build real-time conversational agents with ease.


#### **Prerequisites**
Before we begin, ensure you have the following set up:

1. **Ngrok**: Exposing your local service to the web for Twilio integration.
2. **Twilio**: Setting up Twilio for telephony connectivity.

#### Ngrok setup

To enable Twilio to interact with your local server, you’ll need to expose it to the public internet. Twilio requires a public URL to send requests to your server and receive real-time instructions.

For this guide, we’ll use **ngrok**, a popular tunneling service, to make your local server accessible. Alternatively, you can use other reverse proxy or tunneling options, such as a virtual private server (VPS).

##### **Step 1: Install Ngrok**
If you haven’t already, download and install **ngrok** from their [official website](https://ngrok.com/download). Follow the instructions for your operating system to set it up.

##### **Step 2: Start the Tunnel**
Run the following command to expose your local server on port `5050` (or the port your server uses):

```bash
ngrok http 5050
```

If you’ve configured your server to use a different port, replace `5050` with the correct port number in the command.

##### **Step 3: Retrieve Your Public URL**
After running the command, **ngrok** will display a public URL in your terminal. It will look something like this:

```plaintext
Forwarding                    https://abc123.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:5050
```

Copy this public URL (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok.io`). You will use it in Twilio’s configuration to route incoming requests to your server.

With your public URL set up, you’re ready to configure Twilio to send requests to your server!

#### **Twilio Setup**

To connect Twilio with your RealtimeAgent, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Twilio Account**
   If you don’t already have a Twilio account, you can [sign up here](https://login.twilio.com/u/signup). Twilio offers trial accounts, which are perfect for testing purposes.

2. **Access Your Voice-Enabled Number**
   Log in to the **Twilio Console** and select your **Voice-enabled phone number**.

3. **Configure the Webhook**
   - Navigate to the **Voice & Fax** section under your number’s settings.
   - Set the **A CALL COMES IN** webhook to your public **ngrok** URL.
   - Append `/incoming-call` to the URL. For example:
     - If your ngrok URL is `https://abc123.ngrok.app`, the webhook URL should be:
       `https://abc123.ngrok.app/incoming-call`

4. **Save Changes**
   Once the webhook URL is set, save your changes.

You’re now ready to test the integration between Twilio and your RealtimeAgent!

### **Swarm Implementation for Airline Customer Service**
In this section, we’ll configure a Swarm to handle airline customer service tasks, such as flight changes and cancellations. This implementation builds upon the [original Swarm example notebook](/docs/notebooks/agentchat_swarm), which we’ve adapted to work seamlessly with the RealtimeAgent acting as a `UserProxyAgent`.

You can explore and run the complete implementation of the RealtimeAgent demonstrated here by visiting [this notebook](/docs/notebooks/agentchat_realtime_swarm).

For the sake of brevity, we’ll focus on the key sections of the Swarm setup in this blog post, highlighting the essential components.

Below are the key parts of the Swarm setup, accompanied by concise comments to clarify their purpose and functionality.

#### **Policy Definitions**
```python
FLIGHT_CANCELLATION_POLICY = """
1. Confirm which flight the customer is asking to cancel.
2. Confirm refund or flight credits and proceed accordingly.
...
"""
```
- **Purpose:** Defines the detailed step-by-step process for specific tasks like flight cancellations.
- **Usage:** Used as part of the agent's `system_message` to guide its behavior.

#### **Agents Definition**
```python
triage_agent = SwarmAgent(
    name="Triage_Agent",
    system_message=triage_instructions(context_variables=context_variables),
    llm_config=llm_config,
    functions=[non_flight_enquiry],
)
```
- **Triage Agent:** Routes the user's request to the appropriate specialized agent based on the topic.

```python
flight_cancel = SwarmAgent(
    name="Flight_Cancel_Traversal",
    system_message=STARTER_PROMPT + FLIGHT_CANCELLATION_POLICY,
    llm_config=llm_config,
    functions=[initiate_refund, initiate_flight_credits, case_resolved, escalate_to_agent],
)
```
- **Flight Cancel Agent:** Handles cancellations, including refunds and flight credits, while ensuring policy steps are strictly followed.

```python
flight_modification.register_hand_off(
    [
        ON_CONDITION(flight_cancel, "To cancel a flight"),
        ON_CONDITION(flight_change, "To change a flight"),
    ]
)
```
- **Nested Handoffs:** Further refines routing, enabling deeper task-specific flows like cancellations or changes.

#### **Utility Functions**
```python
def escalate_to_agent(reason: str = None) -> str:
    """Escalates the interaction to a human agent if required."""
    return f"Escalating to agent: {reason}" if reason else "Escalating to agent"
```
- **Purpose:** Ensures seamless fallback to human agents when automated handling is insufficient.

```python
def initiate_refund() -> str:
    """Handles initiating a refund process."""
    return "Refund initiated"
```
- **Task-Specific:** Simplifies complex actions into modular, reusable functions.

### **Connecting the Swarm to the RealtimeAgent**

In this section, we will connect the Swarm to the **RealtimeAgent**, enabling real-time voice interaction and task delegation. To achieve this, we use FastAPI to create a lightweight server that acts as a bridge between Twilio and the RealtimeAgent.

The key functionalities of this implementation include:

1. **Setting Up a REST Endpoint**
   We define a REST API endpoint, `/incoming-call`, to handle incoming voice calls from Twilio. This endpoint returns a Twilio Markup Language (TwiML) response, connecting the call to Twilio’s Media Stream for real-time audio data transfer.

```python
app.api_route("/incoming-call", methods=["GET", "POST"])
async def handle_incoming_call(request: Request):
    """Handle incoming call and return TwiML response to connect to Media Stream."""
    response = VoiceResponse()
    response.say("Please wait while we connect your call to the AI voice assistant.")
    response.pause(length=1)
    response.say("O.K. you can start talking!")
    host = request.url.hostname
    connect = Connect()
    connect.stream(url=f"wss://{host}/media-stream")
    response.append(connect)
    return HTMLResponse(content=str(response), media_type="application/xml")
```
2. **WebSocket Media Stream**
   A WebSocket endpoint, `/media-stream`, is established to manage real-time audio communication between Twilio and a realtime model inference client such as OpenAI's realtime API. This allows audio data to flow seamlessly, enabling the RealtimeAgent to process and respond to user queries.
```python
@app.websocket("/media-stream")
async def handle_media_stream(websocket: WebSocket):
    """Handle WebSocket connections between Twilio and realtime model inference client."""
    await websocket.accept()
    ...
```
3. **Initializing the RealtimeAgent**
   Inside the WebSocket handler, we instantiate the **RealtimeAgent** with the following components:
   - **Name**: The identifier for the agent (e.g., `Customer_service_Bot`).
   - **LLM Configuration**: The configuration for the underlying realtime model inference client that powers the agent.
   - **Audio Adapter**: A TwilioAudioAdapter is used to handle audio streaming between Twilio and the agent.
```python
   audio_adapter = TwilioAudioAdapter(websocket)

   realtime_agent = RealtimeAgent(
        name="Customer_service_Bot",
        llm_config=realtime_llm_config,
        audio_adapter=audio_adapter,
   )
```
4. **Registering the Swarm**
   The RealtimeAgent is linked to a Swarm of agents responsible for different customer service tasks.
   - `initial_agent`: The first agent to process incoming queries (e.g., a triage agent).
   - `agents`: A list of specialized agents for handling specific tasks like flight modifications, cancellations, or lost baggage.
```python
   realtime_agent.register_swarm(
        initial_agent=triage_agent,
        agents=[triage_agent, flight_modification, flight_cancel, flight_change, lost_baggage],
   )
```
5. **Running the RealtimeAgent**
   The `run()` method is invoked to start the RealtimeAgent, enabling it to handle real-time voice interactions and delegate tasks to the registered Swarm agents.
```python
   await realtime_agent.run()
```
Here is the full code for this integration:

```python
app = FastAPI(title="Realtime Swarm Agent Chat", version="0.1.0")


@app.get("/", response_class=JSONResponse)
async def index_page():
    return {"message": "Twilio Media Stream Server is running!"}


@app.api_route("/incoming-call", methods=["GET", "POST"])
async def handle_incoming_call(request: Request):
    """Handle incoming call and return TwiML response to connect to Media Stream."""
    response = VoiceResponse()
    response.say("Please wait while we connect your call to the AI voice assistant.")
    response.pause(length=1)
    response.say("O.K. you can start talking!")
    host = request.url.hostname
    connect = Connect()
    connect.stream(url=f"wss://{host}/media-stream")
    response.append(connect)
    return HTMLResponse(content=str(response), media_type="application/xml")


@app.websocket("/media-stream")
async def handle_media_stream(websocket: WebSocket):
    """Handle WebSocket connections between Twilio and realtime model inference client."""
    await websocket.accept()

    audio_adapter = TwilioAudioAdapter(websocket)

    realtime_agent = RealtimeAgent(
        name="Customer_service_Bot",
        llm_config=realtime_llm_config,
        audio_adapter=audio_adapter,
    )

    realtime_agent.register_swarm(
        initial_agent=triage_agent,
        agents=[triage_agent, flight_modification, flight_cancel, flight_change, lost_baggage],
    )

    await realtime_agent.run()
```

### **Results: Running the Service**

With everything set up, it’s time to put your RealtimeAgent to the test! Follow these steps to make your first call and interact with the AI system:

1. **Ensure Everything is Running**
   - Verify that your **ngrok** session is still active and providing a public URL.
   - Confirm that your FastAPI server is up and running, as outlined in the previous chapters.

2. **Place a Call**
   - Use a cell phone or landline to call your **Twilio number**.

3. **Watch the Magic Happen**
   - Start speaking! You’ll hear the AI system’s initial message and then be able to interact with it in real-time.

#### **Realtime Agent and Swarm Workflow in Action**

The following images showcase the seamless interaction between the **RealtimeAgent** and the Swarm of agents as they work together to handle a live customer request. Here's how the process unfolds:

1. **Service Initialization**
   Our service starts successfully, ready to handle incoming calls and process real-time interactions.
![Realtime Agent Swarm](img/1_service_running.png)

2. **Incoming Call**
   A call comes in, and the **RealtimeAgent** greets us with an audio prompt:
   *“What do you need assistance with today?”*
![Realtime Agent Swarm](img/2_incoming_call.png)

3. **Request Relay to Swarm**
   We respond via audio, requesting to cancel our flight. The **RealtimeAgent** processes this request and relays it to the Swarm team for further action.
![Realtime Agent Swarm](img/3_request_for_flight_cancellation.png)

4. **Clarification from Swarm**
   The Swarm requires additional information, asking for the flight number we want to cancel. The **RealtimeAgent** gathers this detail from us and passes it back to the Swarm.
![Realtime Agent Swarm](img/4_flight_number_name.png)

5. **Policy Confirmation**
   The Swarm then queries us about the refund policy preference (e.g., refund vs. flight credits). The **RealtimeAgent** conveys this question, and after receiving our preference (flight credits), it informs the Swarm.
![Realtime Agent Swarm](img/5_refund_policy.png)

6. **Successful Resolution**
   The Swarm successfully processes the cancellation and initiates the refund. The **RealtimeAgent** communicates this resolution to us over audio:
   *“Your refund has been successfully initiated.”*
![Realtime Agent Swarm](img/6_flight_refunded.png)

This flow highlights the power of integrating real-time audio interaction with the collaborative capabilities of a Swarm of AI agents, providing efficient and user-friendly solutions to complex tasks.

### **Caveats and Future Improvements**

While the RealtimeAgent and Swarm integration is a powerful tool, there are a few things to keep in mind as we continue to refine the system:

- **Work in Progress**: The agent is still evolving, and we’re actively polishing its details for a smoother experience in the coming weeks.
- **Transcription Challenges**: Occasionally, the agent may mishear inputs, particularly when dictating complex information like flight numbers or letters.
- **Response Misdirection**: At times, the agent might respond directly instead of relaying information to the customer. We’re addressing this with prompt optimizations.
- **Simpler Setup Coming Soon**: Setting up Twilio can be time-consuming, but we’re developing a **LocalAdapter** that will let you interact with the agent directly via your web browser audio—perfect for quick testing without the long setup.

We’re excited about what’s to come and look forward to your feedback as we refine and expand these capabilities!
