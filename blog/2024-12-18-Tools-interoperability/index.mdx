You’ll see how to set up agents, adapt the tools, and validate the integration through examples.his post, you will understand how to configure agents, adapt these tools for use in AG2, and validate the integration through practical examples.

## LangChain Tools Integration

LangChain is a popular framework that offers a wide range of tools to work with LLMs. LangChain has already implemented a variety of tools that can be easily integrated into AG2. You can explore the available tools in the [LangChain Community Tools](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/tree/master/libs/community/langchain_community/tools) folder. These tools, such as those for querying APIs, web scraping, and text generation, can be quickly incorporated into AG2, providing powerful functionality for your agents.

### Installation
To integrate LangChain tools into the AG2 framework, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install ag2[interop-langchain]
```

Additionally, this notebook uses LangChain's [Wikipedia Tool](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/tools/langchain_community.tools.wikipedia.tool.WikipediaQueryRun.html), which requires the `wikipedia` package. Install it with:

```bash
pip install wikipedia
```

### Imports

Import necessary modules and tools.
- `WikipediaQueryRun` and `WikipediaAPIWrapper`: Tools for querying Wikipedia.
- `AssistantAgent` and `UserProxyAgent`: Agents that facilitate communication in the AG2 framework.
- `Interoperability`: This module acts as a bridge, making it easier to integrate LangChain tools with AG2’s architecture.

```python
import os

from langchain_community.tools import WikipediaQueryRun
from langchain_community.utilities import WikipediaAPIWrapper

from autogen import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent
from autogen.interop import Interoperability
```

### Agent Configuration

Configure the agents for the interaction.
- `config_list` defines the LLM configurations, including the model and API key.
- `UserProxyAgent` simulates user inputs without requiring actual human interaction (set to `NEVER`).
- `AssistantAgent` represents the AI agent, configured with the LLM settings.

```python
config_list = [{"model": "gpt-4o", "api_key": os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]}]
user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(
    name="User",
    human_input_mode="NEVER",
)

chatbot = AssistantAgent(
    name="chatbot",
    llm_config={"config_list": config_list},
)
```

### Tool Integration

- Initialize and register the LangChain tool with AG2.
- `WikipediaAPIWrapper`: Configured to fetch the top 1 result from Wikipedia with a maximum of 1000 characters per document.
- `WikipediaQueryRun`: A LangChain tool that executes Wikipedia queries.
- `LangchainInteroperability`: Converts the LangChain tool into a format compatible with the AG2 framework.
- `ag2_tool.register_for_execution(user_proxy)`: Registers the tool for use by the user_proxy agent.
- `ag2_tool.register_for_llm(chatbot)`: Registers the tool for integration with the chatbot agent.

```python
api_wrapper = WikipediaAPIWrapper(top_k_results=1, doc_content_chars_max=1000)
langchain_tool = WikipediaQueryRun(api_wrapper=api_wrapper)

interop = Interoperability()
ag2_tool = interop.convert_tool(tool=langchain_tool, type="langchain")

ag2_tool.register_for_execution(user_proxy)
ag2_tool.register_for_llm(chatbot)
```

### Initiate Chat
```python
message = "Tell me about the history of the United States"
user_proxy.initiate_chat(recipient=chatbot, message=message, max_turns=2)
```

Output:

```console
User (to chatbot):

Summary: The history of the lands that became the United States began with the arrival of the first people in the Americas around 15,000 BC. After European colonization of North America began in the late 15th century, wars and epidemics decimated Indigenous societies. By the 1760s, the thirteen British colonies were established. The Southern Colonies built an agricultural system on slave labor, enslaving millions from Africa. After defeating France, the British Parliament imposed a series of taxes; resistance to these taxes, especially the Boston Tea Party in 1773, led to Parliament issuing the Intolerable Acts designed to end self-government.

The history of the United States begins with the arrival of the first peoples in the Americas around 15,000 BC. This pre-Columbian era was followed by European colonization, beginning in the late 15th century, which dramatically altered the indigenous societies through wars and epidemics.

By the 1760s, thirteen British colonies were established along the Atlantic seaboard. In the Southern Colonies, an agricultural economy heavily reliant on enslaved labor from Africa was developed. The British victory over France in the Seven Years' War led Parliament to impose various taxes on the colonies. Resistance to these taxes, exemplified by the Boston Tea Party in 1773, prompted the Parliament to enact the Intolerable Acts, seeking to curtail colonial self-governance.

The United States declared independence in 1776. Under the leadership of General George Washington, the American Revolutionary War concluded successfully in 1783. Subsequently, the U.S. Constitution was adopted in 1789, with the Bill of Rights added in 1791 to ensure inalienable rights. During this early period, President George Washington and his advisor Alexander Hamilton played significant roles in forming the young nation's governmental and economic foundations.

This overview covers the early formation and foundational moments of what became the United States, setting the stage for the country's subsequent expansion and development. TERMINATE

## PydanticAI Tools Integration

[PydanticAI](https://ai.pydantic.dev/) is a newer framework that offers powerful capabilities for working with LLMs. Although it currently does not have a repository with pre-built tools, it provides features like **dependency injection**, allowing you to inject a "Context" into a tool for better execution without relying on LLMs. This context can be used for passing parameters or managing state during the execution of a tool. While the framework is still growing, you can integrate its tools into AG2 to enhance agent capabilities, especially for tasks that involve structured data and context-driven logic.

### Installation
To integrate LangChain tools into the AG2 framework, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install ag2[interop-pydantic-ai]
```


### Imports

Import necessary modules and tools.
- `BaseModel`: Used to define data structures for tool inputs and outputs.
- `RunContext`: Provides context during the execution of tools.
- `PydanticAITool`: Represents a tool in the PydanticAI framework.
- `AssistantAgent` and `UserProxyAgent`: Agents that facilitate communication in the AG2 framework.
- `Interoperability`: This module acts as a bridge, making it easier to integrate PydanticAI tools with AG2’s architecture.

```python
import os
from typing import Optional

from pydantic import BaseModel
from pydantic_ai import RunContext
from pydantic_ai.tools import Tool as PydanticAITool

from autogen import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent
from autogen.interop import Interoperability
```

### Agent Configuration

Configure the agents for the interaction.
- `config_list` defines the LLM configurations, including the model and API key.
- `UserProxyAgent` simulates user inputs without requiring actual human interaction (set to `NEVER`).
- `AssistantAgent` represents the AI agent, configured with the LLM settings.

```python
config_list = [{"model": "gpt-4o", "api_key": os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]}]
user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(
    name="User",
    human_input_mode="NEVER",
)

chatbot = AssistantAgent(
    name="chatbot",
    llm_config={"config_list": config_list},
)
```

### Tool Integration

Integrate the PydanticAI tool with AG2.

- Define a `Player` model using `BaseModel` to structure the input data.
- Use `RunContext` to securely inject dependencies (like the `Player` instance) into the tool function without exposing them to the LLM.
- Implement `get_player` to define the tool's functionality, accessing `ctx.deps` for injected data.
- Convert the tool to an AG2-compatible format with `Interoperability` and register it for execution and LLM communication.
- Convert the PydanticAI tool into an AG2-compatible format using `convert_tool`.
- Register the tool for both execution and communication with the LLM by associating it with the `user_proxy` and `chatbot`.

```python
class Player(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int


def get_player(ctx: RunContext[Player], additional_info: Optional[str] = None) -> str:  # type: ignore[valid-type]
    """Get the player's name.

    Args:
        additional_info: Additional information which can be used.
    """
    return f"Name: {ctx.deps.name}, Age: {ctx.deps.age}, Additional info: {additional_info}"  # type: ignore[attr-defined]


interop = Interoperability()
pydantic_ai_tool = PydanticAITool(get_player, takes_ctx=True)

# player will be injected as a dependency
player = Player(name="Luka", age=25)
ag2_tool = interop.convert_tool(tool=pydantic_ai_tool, type="pydanticai", deps=player)

ag2_tool.register_for_execution(user_proxy)
ag2_tool.register_for_llm(chatbot)
```

Initiate a conversation between the `UserProxyAgent` and the `AssistantAgent`.

- Use the `initiate_chat` method to send a message from the `user_proxy` to the `chatbot`.
- In this example, the user requests the chatbot to retrieve player information, providing "goal keeper" as additional context.
- The `Player` instance is securely injected into the tool using `RunContext`, ensuring the chatbot can retrieve and use this data during the interaction.

```python
user_proxy.initiate_chat(
    recipient=chatbot, message="Get player, for additional information use 'goal keeper'", max_turns=3
)
```

Output:

```console
User (to chatbot):

Get player, for additional information use 'goal keeper'
