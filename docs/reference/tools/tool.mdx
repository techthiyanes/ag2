## Tool

```python
class Tool()
```

A class representing a Tool that can be used by an agent for various tasks.

This class encapsulates a tool with a name, description, and an executable function.
The tool can be registered with a ConversableAgent for use either with an LLM or for direct execution.

**Attributes**:

- `name` _str_ - The name of the tool.
- `description` _str_ - A brief description of the tool's purpose or function.
- `func` _Callable[..., Any]_ - The function to be executed when the tool is called.

### \_\_init\_\_

```python
def __init__(name: str, description: str, func: Callable[..., Any]) -> None
```

Create a new Tool object.

**Arguments**:

- `name` _str_ - The name of the tool.
- `description` _str_ - The description of the tool.
- `func` _Callable[..., Any]_ - The function that will be executed when the tool is called.

### register\_for\_llm

```python
def register_for_llm(agent: ConversableAgent) -> None
```

Registers the tool for use with a ConversableAgent's language model (LLM).

This method registers the tool so that it can be invoked by the agent during
interactions with the language model.

**Arguments**:

- `agent` _ConversableAgent_ - The agent to which the tool will be registered.

### register\_for\_execution

```python
def register_for_execution(agent: ConversableAgent) -> None
```

Registers the tool for direct execution by a ConversableAgent.

This method registers the tool so that it can be executed by the agent,
typically outside of the context of an LLM interaction.

**Arguments**:

- `agent` _ConversableAgent_ - The agent to which the tool will be registered.
