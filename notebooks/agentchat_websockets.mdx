This notebook demonstrates how to use the
[`IOStream`](https://ag2ai.github.io/ag2/docs/reference/io/base/IOStream)
class to stream both input and output using websockets. The use of
websockets allows you to build web clients that are more responsive than
the one using web methods. The main difference is that the webosockets
allows you to push data while you need to poll the server for new
response using web mothods.

In this guide, we explore the capabilities of the
[`IOStream`](https://ag2ai.github.io/ag2/docs/reference/io/base/IOStream)
class. It is specifically designed to enhance the development of clients
such as web clients which use websockets for streaming both input and
output. The
[`IOStream`](https://ag2ai.github.io/ag2/docs/reference/io/base/IOStream)
stands out by enabling a more dynamic and interactive user experience
for web applications.

Websockets technology is at the core of this functionality, offering a
significant advancement over traditional web methods by allowing data to
be “pushed” to the client in real-time. This is a departure from the
conventional approach where clients must repeatedly “poll” the server to
check for any new responses. By employing the underlining
[websockets](https://websockets.readthedocs.io/) library, the IOStream
class facilitates a continuous, two-way communication channel between
the server and client. This ensures that updates are received instantly,
without the need for constant polling, thereby making web clients more
efficient and responsive.

The real power of websockets, leveraged through the
[`IOStream`](https://ag2ai.github.io/ag2/docs/reference/io/base/IOStream)
class, lies in its ability to create highly responsive web clients. This
responsiveness is critical for applications requiring real-time data
updates such as chat applications. By integrating the
[`IOStream`](https://ag2ai.github.io/ag2/docs/reference/io/base/IOStream)
class into your web application, you not only enhance user experience
through immediate data transmission but also reduce the load on your
server by eliminating unnecessary polling.

In essence, the transition to using websockets through the
[`IOStream`](https://ag2ai.github.io/ag2/docs/reference/io/base/IOStream)
class marks a significant enhancement in web client development. This
approach not only streamlines the data exchange process between clients
and servers but also opens up new possibilities for creating more
interactive and engaging web applications. By following this guide,
developers can harness the full potential of websockets and the
[`IOStream`](https://ag2ai.github.io/ag2/docs/reference/io/base/IOStream)
class to push the boundaries of what is possible with web client
responsiveness and interactivity.

## Defining `on_connect` function

An `on_connect` function is a crucial part of applications that utilize
websockets, acting as an event handler that is called whenever a new
client connection is established. This function is designed to initiate
any necessary setup, communication protocols, or data exchange
procedures specific to the newly connected client. Essentially, it lays
the groundwork for the interactive session that follows, configuring how
the server and the client will communicate and what initial actions are
to be taken once a connection is made. Now, let’s delve into the details
of how to define this function, especially in the context of using the
AutoGen framework with websockets.

Upon a client’s connection to the websocket server, the server
automatically initiates a new instance of the
[`IOWebsockets`](https://ag2ai.github.io/ag2/docs/reference/io/websockets/IOWebsockets)
class. This instance is crucial for managing the data flow between the
server and the client. The `on_connect` function leverages this instance
to set up the communication protocol, define interaction rules, and
initiate any preliminary data exchanges or configurations required for
the client-server interaction to proceed smoothly.

```python
def on_connect(iostream: IOWebsockets) -> None:
    print(f" - on_connect(): Connected to client using IOWebsockets {iostream}", flush=True)

    print(" - on_connect(): Receiving message from client.", flush=True)

    # 1. Receive Initial Message
    initial_msg = iostream.input()

    # 2. Instantiate ConversableAgent
    agent = autogen.ConversableAgent(
        name="chatbot",
        system_message="Complete a task given to you and reply TERMINATE when the task is done. If asked about the weather, use tool 'weather_forecast(city)' to get the weather forecast for a city.",
        llm_config={
            "config_list": autogen.config_list_from_json(
                env_or_file="OAI_CONFIG_LIST",
                filter_dict={
                    "model": ["gpt-4", "gpt-3.5-turbo", "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k"],
                },
            ),
            "stream": True,
        },
    )

    # 3. Define UserProxyAgent
    user_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent(
        name="user_proxy",
        system_message="A proxy for the user.",
        is_termination_msg=lambda x: x.get("content", "") and x.get("content", "").rstrip().endswith("TERMINATE"),
        human_input_mode="NEVER",
        max_consecutive_auto_reply=10,
        code_execution_config=False,
    )

    # 4. Define Agent-specific Functions
    def weather_forecast(city: str) -> str:
        return f"The weather forecast for {city} at {datetime.now()} is sunny."

    autogen.register_function(
        weather_forecast, caller=agent, executor=user_proxy, description="Weather forecast for a city"
    )

    # 5. Initiate conversation
    print(
        f" - on_connect(): Initiating chat with agent {agent} using message '{initial_msg}'",
        flush=True,
    )
    user_proxy.initiate_chat(  # noqa: F704
        agent,
        message=initial_msg,
    )
```

Here’s an explanation on how a typical `on_connect` function such as the
one in the example above is defined:

1.  **Receive Initial Message**: Immediately after establishing a
    connection, receive an initial message from the client. This step is
    crucial for understanding the client’s request or initiating the
    conversation flow.

2.  **Instantiate ConversableAgent**: Create an instance of
    ConversableAgent with a specific system message and the LLM
    configuration. If you need more than one agent, make sure they don’t
    share the same `llm_config` as adding a function to one of them will
    also attempt to add it to another.

3.  **Instantiate UserProxyAgent**: Similarly, create a UserProxyAgent
    instance, defining its termination condition, human input mode, and
    other relevant parameters. There is no need to define `llm_config`
    as the UserProxyAgent does not use LLM.

4.  **Define Agent-specific Functions**: If your conversable agent
    requires executing specific tasks, such as fetching a weather
    forecast in the example above, define these functions within the
    on_connect scope. Decorate these functions accordingly to link them
    with your agents.

5.  **Initiate Conversation**: Finally, use the `initiate_chat` method
    of your `UserProxyAgent` to start the interaction with the
    conversable agent, passing the initial message and a cache mechanism
    for efficiency.

## Testing websockets server with Python client

Testing an `on_connect` function with a Python client involves
simulating a client-server interaction to ensure the setup, data
exchange, and communication protocols function as intended. Here’s a
brief explanation on how to conduct this test using a Python client:

1.  **Start the Websocket Server**: Use the
    `IOWebsockets.run_server_in_thread method` to start the server in a
    separate thread, specifying the on_connect function and the port.
    This method returns the URI of the running websocket server.

2.  **Connect to the Server**: Open a connection to the server using the
    returned URI. This simulates a client initiating a connection to
    your websocket server.

3.  **Send a Message to the Server**: Once connected, send a message
    from the client to the server. This tests the server’s ability to
    receive messages through the established websocket connection.

4.  **Receive and Process Messages**: Implement a loop to continuously
    receive messages from the server. Decode the messages if necessary,
    and process them accordingly. This step verifies the server’s
    ability to respond back to the client’s request.

This test scenario effectively evaluates the interaction between a
client and a server using the `on_connect` function, by simulating a
realistic message exchange. It ensures that the server can handle
incoming connections, process messages, and communicate responses back
to the client, all critical functionalities for a robust websocket-based
application.

```python
with IOWebsockets.run_server_in_thread(on_connect=on_connect, port=8765) as uri:
    print(f" - test_setup() with websocket server running on {uri}.", flush=True)

    with ws_connect(uri) as websocket:
        print(f" - Connected to server on {uri}", flush=True)

        print(" - Sending message to server.", flush=True)
        # websocket.send("2+2=?")
        websocket.send("Check out the weather in Paris and write a poem about it.")

        while True:
            message = websocket.recv()
            message = message.decode("utf-8") if isinstance(message, bytes) else message

            print(message, end="", flush=True)

            if "TERMINATE" in message:
                print()
                print(" - Received TERMINATE message. Exiting.", flush=True)
                break
```

## Testing websockets server running inside FastAPI server with HTML/JS client

The code snippets below outlines an approach for testing an `on_connect`
function in a web environment using
[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) to serve a simple interactive
HTML page. This method allows users to send messages through a web
interface, which are then processed by the server running the AutoGen
framework via websockets. Here’s a step-by-step explanation:

1.  **FastAPI Application Setup**: The code initiates by importing
    necessary libraries and setting up a FastAPI application. FastAPI is
    a modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+
    based on standard Python type hints.

2.  **HTML Template for User Interaction**: An HTML template is defined
    as a multi-line Python string, which includes a basic form for
    message input and a script for managing websocket communication.
    This template creates a user interface where messages can be sent to
    the server and responses are displayed dynamically.

3.  **Running the Websocket Server**: The `run_websocket_server` async
    context manager starts the websocket server using
    `IOWebsockets.run_server_in_thread` with the specified `on_connect`
    function and port. This server listens for incoming websocket
    connections.

4.  **FastAPI Route for Serving HTML Page**: A FastAPI route
    (`@app.get("/")`) is defined to serve the HTML page to users. When a
    user accesses the root URL, the HTML content for the websocket chat
    is returned, allowing them to interact with the websocket server.

5.  **Starting the FastAPI Application**: Lastly, the FastAPI
    application is started using Uvicorn, an ASGI server, configured
    with the app and additional parameters as needed. The server is then
    launched to serve the FastAPI application, making the interactive
    HTML page accessible to users.

This method of testing allows for interactive communication between the
user and the server, providing a practical way to demonstrate and
evaluate the behavior of the on_connect function in real-time. Users can
send messages through the webpage, and the server processes these
messages as per the logic defined in the on_connect function, showcasing
the capabilities and responsiveness of the AutoGen framework’s websocket
handling in a user-friendly manner.

The testing setup described above, leveraging FastAPI and websockets,
not only serves as a robust testing framework for the on_connect
function but also lays the groundwork for developing real-world
applications. This approach exemplifies how web-based interactions can
be made dynamic and real-time, a critical aspect of modern application
development.

For instance, this setup can be directly applied or adapted to build
interactive chat applications, real-time data dashboards, or live
support systems. The integration of websockets enables the server to
push updates to clients instantly, a key feature for applications that
rely on the timely delivery of information. For example, a chat
application built on this framework can support instantaneous messaging
between users, enhancing user engagement and satisfaction.

Moreover, the simplicity and interactivity of the HTML page used for
testing reflect how user interfaces can be designed to provide seamless
experiences. Developers can expand upon this foundation to incorporate
more sophisticated elements such as user authentication, message
encryption, and custom user interactions, further tailoring the
application to meet specific use case requirements.

The flexibility of the FastAPI framework, combined with the real-time
communication enabled by websockets, provides a powerful toolset for
developers looking to build scalable, efficient, and highly interactive
web applications. Whether it’s for creating collaborative platforms,
streaming services, or interactive gaming experiences, this testing
setup offers a glimpse into the potential applications that can be
developed with these technologies.

## Testing websockets server with HTML/JS client

The provided code snippet below is an example of how to create an
interactive testing environment for an `on_connect` function using
Python’s built-in `http.server` module. This setup allows for real-time
interaction within a web browser, enabling developers to test the
websocket functionality in a more user-friendly and practical manner.
Here’s a breakdown of how this code operates and its potential
applications:

1.  **Serving a Simple HTML Page**: The code starts by defining an HTML
    page that includes a form for sending messages and a list to display
    incoming messages. JavaScript is used to handle the form submission
    and websocket communication.

2.  **Temporary Directory for HTML File**: A temporary directory is
    created to store the HTML file. This approach ensures that the
    testing environment is clean and isolated, minimizing conflicts with
    existing files or configurations.

3.  **Custom HTTP Request Handler**: A custom subclass of
    `SimpleHTTPRequestHandler` is defined to serve the HTML file. This
    handler overrides the do_GET method to redirect the root path (`/`)
    to the `chat.html` page, ensuring that visitors to the server’s root
    URL are immediately presented with the chat interface.

4.  **Starting the Websocket Server**: Concurrently, a websocket server
    is started on a different port using the
    `IOWebsockets.run_server_in_thread` method, with the previously
    defined `on_connect` function as the callback for new connections.

5.  **HTTP Server for the HTML Interface**: An HTTP server is
    instantiated to serve the HTML chat interface, enabling users to
    interact with the websocket server through a web browser.

This setup showcases a practical application of integrating websockets
with a simple HTTP server to create a dynamic and interactive web
application. By using Python’s standard library modules, it demonstrates
a low-barrier entry to developing real-time applications such as chat
systems, live notifications, or interactive dashboards.

The key takeaway from this code example is how easily Python’s built-in
libraries can be leveraged to prototype and test complex web
functionalities. For developers looking to build real-world
applications, this approach offers a straightforward method to validate
and refine websocket communication logic before integrating it into
larger frameworks or systems. The simplicity and accessibility of this
testing setup make it an excellent starting point for developing a wide
range of interactive web applications.
