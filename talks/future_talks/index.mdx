### Abstract:

Current LLM-based orchestration tools often lack support for multi-agent interactions, are restricted to basic communication patterns, or only provide information after the entire workflow has completed. Waldiez is an open-source workflow tool that lets you orchestrate your LLM-agents using drag-and-drop and develop complex agentic applications.  It is a low-code tool that assists you design and visualize your multi-agent workflow in jupyter lab as a plugin. Wadiez runs over AG2 supporting all the communication patterns (e.g., sequential, nested and group chat), supporting several LLM-based services offered by OpenAI, Anthropic, NVIDIA NIM, local hosted models and several others.  In this talk, we’ll dive into the powerful features of Wadiez, demonstrating its capabilities through real-world use cases. Join us as we explore how Wadiez can streamline complex workflows and enhance multi-agent interactions, showcasing exactly what sets it apart from other LLM-based orchestration tools.
